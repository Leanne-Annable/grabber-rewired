## Description

A web application to grab recipes with ingredients and instructions by inputting some basic search criteria
<br>


## User Story

AS someone struggling to think of what to cook <br/>
I WANT an app that can help me figure out what meal to cook from some ingredients I have in <br/> 
SO THAT I can create a tasty meal to feast on!

## Project Requirements

For this project we needed to create a responsive web application with the following requirements

<ul>
    <li>Application uses REACT,</li>
    <li>At least 2 GET routes for retrieving data, </li>
    <li>At least 2 new technologies/libraries/packages previously not used in class, </li>
</ul>

All of which had to be able to deploy properly on netlify. <br/>

## Usage

When loading the web app page you will be greeted with the home page, this includes buttons to Sign up, Login, or continue as guest.<br/>
You will then be redirected to the main page, here you can use the search bar to input your food search criteria, whether it be a specific ingredient or a cuisine style, a selection of dietry requirements, or just the word food for a variety of choice.<br/>
You will then see a selection of recipe cards with images and titles which, when clicked, will open a new page that shows the ingredients and recipe steps.<br/>
Don't like what you see? just click the back button and try another recipe, or search for a new ingredient to have a new list generated.<br/>
When you have found a recipe you like, you then have the option to save the recipe, print it out, or email it to yourself or a friend.<br/>
Then all you have to do is cook! Unfortunately, we can't help you with that part!
