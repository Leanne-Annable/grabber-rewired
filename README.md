## Project Requirements

For this project we needed to create a responsive web application with the following requirements

<ul>
    <li>Application uses REACT,</li>
    <li>It has at least 2 GET routes for retrieving data, </li>
    <li>And uses at least 2 new technologies/libraries/packages not previously used. </li>
</ul>

All of which had to be able to deploy properly on netlify. <br/>

## Usage

When loading the web app page you will be greeted with the home page, this includes buttons to Sign up, Login, or continue as guest.<br/>
You will then be redirected to the main page, here you can use the search bar to input your food search criteria, whether it be a specific ingredient or a cuisine style, a selection of dietry requirements, or just the word food for a variety of choice.<br/>
You will then see a selection of recipe cards with images and titles which, when clicked, will open a new page that shows the ingredients and recipe steps.<br/>
Don't like what you see? just click the back button and try another recipe, or search for a new ingredient to have a new list generated.<br/>
When you have found a recipe you like, you then have the option to save the recipe, print it out, or email it to yourself or a friend.<br/>
Then all you have to do is cook! Unfortunately, we can't help you with that part!
